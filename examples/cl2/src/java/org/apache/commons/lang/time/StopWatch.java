/**
 * <p><code>StopWatch</code> provides a convenient API for timings.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The methods do <b>not</b> protect against inappropriate calls. Thus you
 * can call stop before start, resume before suspend or unsplit before split.
 * The results are indeterminate in these cases.</p>
 * 
 * <p>To start the watch, call {@link #start()}. At this point you can:</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #split()} the watch to get the time whilst the watch continues in the
 *  background. {@link #unsplit()} will remove the effect of the split. At this point,
 *  these three options are available again.
 * <li>{@link #suspend()} the watch to pause it. {@link #resume()} allows the watch
 *  to continue. Any time between the suspend and resume will not be counted in
 *  the total. At this point, these three options are available again.
 * <li>{@link #stop()} the watch to complete the timing session.
 * </ul>
 * <p>It is intended that the output methods {@link #toString()} and {@link #getTime()}
 * should only be called after stop, split or suspend, however a suitable result will
 * be returned at other points.</p>
