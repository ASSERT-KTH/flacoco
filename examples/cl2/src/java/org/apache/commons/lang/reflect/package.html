<p>Assists in reflection with the aim to create a simple, clean and clear API which can be built upon on by more 
sophisticated introspection schemes as well as fixes for bugs found in various 
Java implementations.</p>

<h2>Accessibility Rules</h2>
<p>These determine which methods are in scope</p>

<h3>Java Language Specification Rules</h3>
<p>The <em>Java Language Specification Rules</em> are those that are given in the  
<em>Java Language Specification</em> as applied by the compiler.
The aim of those methods who contract is given as the <em>Java Language Specification</em> 
is to behave in an identical manner to compiled code. 
In other words, any code that would compile should be found by reflection 
 and any code that would not should not</p>
<h4>Java 1.3 And Below</h4>
<p>This aim is actually easier said than done for some java versions. 
The reflection implementation is slow and buggy. 
If you are using one of these easier java versions, then you will probably find our code
more reliable than the standard java implementation.</p>
